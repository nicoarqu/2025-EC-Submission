OSMoSIS (Observation of Social Motor Synchrony with an Interactive System) is a musical motion-based game. The design was inspired by previous research that suggests that music and movement can be helpful in fostering communication and expression skills, and the first author's experiences as a music therapist. OSMoSIS converts movements into sounds, using a Microsoft Kinect-based system which provides full body tracking. A recently conducted evaluation with a group of 11 children with autism aged 5-11 years old showed positive engagement with the system, and some instances of imaginative play. In our discussion, we highlight implications for the design of future music and movement systems to support learning in children with autism.},

   abstract = {The prevalence of autism spectrum disorder (asd) has increased at a significant rate in recent years, especially in developed nations such as the united states, japan, and south korea. Children affected with autism tend to exhibit a spectrum of symptoms depending on the severity of the disease. These behaviors are primarily repetitive, self-stimulatory, and stereotypic behaviors such as hand flapping (i.e., repeatedly shaking their hands), body rocking (i.e., swaying their body back and forth), drumming, walking around in a confined space, and walking with shortened steps on toes, etc. in this research project, a simple reminder system is proposed using wearable sensors to automatically detect significant hand flapping movements. The reminder system consists of a speaker encoded with the voice of mother, father, or any other custom designed voice. an algorithm was designed to trigger the audio device when the child showed significant hand flapping activity (i.e., hand flapping more than 10 times) within a given time frame. the time frame and the hand flapping count can be customized per severity of the child's symptoms. The device was successfully tested in the laboratory by simulating the hand flapping movement shown by the child. It is hoped that this system provides a valuable service to parents and the child by alerting the child to autistic movements, preventing the habit from turning into self-injurious behavior, and taking away the burden from parents and caregivers.},

   abstract = {The ability to correctly perceive time and extract accurate timing information is crucial during social interaction. In fact, several activities during social interaction, such as appropriate feedback, turn-taking, coordination with peers, and even empathy and engagement exhibition directly depend on it. One of the aspects of cognitive malfunctioning in children with Autistic Spectrum Disorders is time perception deficit. Learning to pay attention to and correctly assess timing is thus a critical first step to improve social skills for children with Autism. In this paper, we present a novel sensing system and algorithm for estimating a subject's rhythmic motion timing from visual information using Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) coupled with FFT. This system will enable a robot saxophonist to estimate the rhythmic period from a child's motion during a robot-based music therapy session. Fast-Fourier-Transform (FFT) is an algorithm widely applied in rhythmic body movement detection, due to advantages such low computation and easy integration. However, long transient time delay is a critical limitation, reducing the correct motion timing estimation during period transitions. The novel system presented in this article is shown to significantly reduce transient time delay. The results of both a simulation and an evaluation experiment show that, compared with FFT processing alone, this algorithm gives a better performance due to its smaller average offset error and shorter transient time delay, allowing a more precise assessment of the child's synchronization response.},

OSMoSIS (Observation of Social Motor Synchrony with an Interactive System) is a musical motion-based game. The design was inspired by previous research that suggests that music and movement can be helpful in fostering communication and expression skills, and the first author's experiences as a music therapist. OSMoSIS converts movements into sounds, using a Microsoft Kinect-based system which provides full body tracking. A recently conducted evaluation with a group of 11 children with autism aged 5– 11 years old showed positive engagement with the system, and some instances of imaginative play. In our discussion, we highlight implications for the design of future music and movement systems to support learning in children with autism.},

Little research has shown the use of interactive sonification in supporting motor therapeutic interventions for children with autism who exhibit motor impairments. The goal of this research is to study if children with autism understand the use of interactive sonification during motor therapeutic interventions, its potential impact of interactive sonification in the development of motor skills in children with autism, and the feasibility of using it in specialized schools for children with autism. We conducted two deployment studies in Mexico using Go-with-the-Flow, a framework to sonify movements previously developed for chronic pain rehabilitation. In the first study, six children with autism were asked to perform the forward reach and lateral upper-limb exercises while listening to three different sound structures (i.e., one discrete and two continuous sounds). Results showed that children with autism exhibit awareness about the sonification of their movements and engage with the sonification. We then adapted the sonifications based on the results of the first study, for motor therapy of children with autism. In the next study, nine children with autism were asked to perform upper-limb lateral, cross-lateral, and push movements while listening to five different sound structures (i.e., three discrete and two continues) designed to sonify the movements. Results showed that discrete sound structures engage the children in the performance of upper-limb movements and increase their ability to perform the movements correctly. We finally propose design considerations that could guide the design of projects related to interactive sonification © 2020, Springer-Verlag London Ltd., part of Springer Nature.},

   abstract = {Movement synchrony refers to the dynamic temporal connection between the motions of interacting people. The automatic measurement of movement synchrony is worth studying for social behavior analysis applications, for instance, in play therapy of children in the autism spectrum. Existing approaches based on motion energy analysis are strongly reliant on the region of interest, and thus limit the interaction between individuals, especially for highly engaging activities like play therapy. Inspired by action quality assessment, a task to assess how well an action has been performed, in this paper, we propose an end-to-end deep learning method to integrate the following major tasks: (1) the automatic assessment of children’s performance in play therapy, and (2) the automatic estimation of movement synchrony between children and therapists, facilitated by an auxiliary task of intervention activity recognition. This multi-task paradigm generally improves the performance of our model across all tasks. Furthermore, when annotations are subjective, the typical exclusive annotation strategy may reduce tagging quality. As a result, we explored applying distribution learning to mitigate human bias in movement synchrony estimation. We allowed the second and third labels for each instance, namely the uncertainty-preserved annotation approach. We tested our method on Play Therapy 13 (PT13), a dataset collected from video recordings of play therapy interventions. The findings of the experiments indicated that our framework can accurately quantify movement synchronization and assess the quality of children’s actions in play therapy. Moreover, the uncertainty-preserved annotation approach produced a comparable outcome to standard methods at a far reduced cost, demonstrating its efficacy in mitigating biases.},

   abstract = {Background: Motor impairment is widely acknowledged as a core feature in children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD), which can affect adaptive behavior and increase severity of symptoms. Low-cost motion capture and virtual reality (VR) game technologies hold a great deal of promise for providing personalized approaches to motor intervention in ASD. The present study explored the feasibility, acceptability and potential efficacy of a custom-designed VR game-based intervention (GaitWayXR™) for improving gross motor skills in youth with ASD. Methods: Ten children and adolescents (10–17 years) completed six, 20-min VR-based motor training sessions over 2 weeks while whole-body movement was tracked with a low-cost motion capture system. We developed a methodology for using motion tracking data to quantify whole-body movement in terms of efficiency, synchrony and symmetry. We then studied the relationships of the above quantities with standardized measures of motor skill and cognitive flexibility. Results: Our results supported our presumption that the VR intervention is safe, with no adverse events and very few minor to moderate side-effects, while a large proportion of parents said they would use the VR game at home, the most prohibitive reasons for adopting the system for home therapy were cost and space. Although there was little evidence of any benefits of the GaitWayXR™ intervention in improving gross motor skills, we showed several positive correlations between the standardized measures of gross motor skills in ASD and our measures of efficiency, symmetry and synchrony from low-cost motion capture. Conclusions: These findings, though preliminary and limited by small sample size, suggest that low-cost motion capture of children with ASD is feasible with movement exercises in a VR-based game environment. Based on these preliminary findings, we recommend conducting larger-scale studies with methods for improving adherence to VR gaming interventions over longer periods. © 2022, The Author(s).},

Eight adults with ASC participated in 12 sessions using a single case experimental design approach over a total period of 19 weeks. Using qualitative and quantitative data, the results show an increase in communicative behaviour, for both verbal and non-verbal participants, resulting from the use of CymaSense.

   abstract = {To investigate how learning in immersive Virtual Reality was designed in contemporary educational studies, this systematic literature review identified nine design features and analysed 219 empirical studies on the designs of learning activities with immersive Virtual Reality. Overall, the technological features for physical presence were more readily implemented and investigated than pedagogical features for learning engagement. Further analysis with k-means clustering revealed five approaches with varying levels of interactivity and openness in learning tasks, from watching virtual worlds passively to responding to personalised prompts. Such differences in the design appeared to stem from different practical and educational priorities, such as accessibility, interactivity, and engagement. This review highlights the diversity in the learning task designs in immersive Virtual Reality and illustrates how researchers are navigating practical and educational concerns. We recommend future empirical studies recognise the different approaches and priorities when designing and evaluating learning with immersive Virtual Reality. We also recommend that future systematic reviews investigate immersive Virtual Reality-based learning not only by learning topics or learner demographics, but also by task designs and learning experiences.},

   abstract = {Gesture interaction provides a multitude of benefits to individuals with developmental disabilities, from enhancing social, motor and cognitive skills to providing a safe and controlled environment for simulating real-world scenarios. As gesture-based applications gain ground in the special education domain, we study their potential in the Indian context. Together with Tamana, an NGO in New Delhi, we have been conducting a series of exploratory user studies since October 2013. This includes the design and evaluation of three gesture-based applications to impart social and life skills to individuals with developmental disabilities. The Kirana application employs socially appropriate gestures to teach the life skill of buying day-to-day items from a local Indian grocery. Balloons promotes joint attention skills through collaborative interaction. HOPE improves motor coordination and social and cognitive skills, with increasing levels of difficulty. Based on studies with these applications, this article presents guidelines for designing gesture-based applications for individuals with developmental disabilities. The guidelines focus on (a) designing applications that cater to a larger group of individuals to encourage collaboration and inclusion, for instance, providing easy and controllable transitions between different task levels, and balancing interaction and content complexity; (b) addressing the challenges in conducting research in this domain, with respect to ethical and procedural decisions; and (c) designing for technology acceptance within the Indian context, for example, by following a collaborative and stakeholder inclusive approach, and addressing apprehensions towards technology adoption. These guidelines aim to benefit other practitioners working in this domain and especially in the educational technology context of India.},

Previous research suggests music and movement therapies are powerful tools for supporting children with autism in their development of communication, expression, and motor skills. OSMoSIS (Observation of Social Motor Synchrony with an Interactive System) is an interactive musical system which tracks body movements and transforms them into sounds using the Microsoft Kinect motion capture system. It is designed so that, regardless of motor abilities, children can generate sounds by moving in the environment either freely or guided by a facilitator. OSMoSIS was inspired by the author's experiences as a music therapist and supports observation of Social Motor Synchrony to allow facilitators and researchers to record and investigate this aspect of the therapy sessions. It converts movements into sounds using Microsoft Kinect body tracking, in the context of an interactive game. From our preliminary testing with 11 children with autism (aged 5 – 11 years old), we observed that our design actively connects children, who displayed a notable increase in engagement and interaction when the system was used.},

Many DGBL studies have been conducted in formal education settings but rarely was the effectiveness of DGBL on adult learners in the context of professional upskilling examined. To examine the influence of DGBL on professional upskilling, we conducted a systematic literature review examining DGBL research conducted over the past 10 years with adult learners. Through analysing 30 articles that met the inclusion criteria, three themes were developed: (a) characteristics of learning-driven digital games, which focus on various learning pedagogies and teaching strategies used in DGBL; (b) game design elements that were used to motivate and sustain players’ engagement in learning, and (c) the research findings that could influence the implementation of DBGL. Based on the results, we recommended a purposeful selection of game design elements as extraneous game design elements can inhibit the learning process. Pedagogical frameworks and teaching strategies, such as sustainable feedback and a supportive learning process, are also recommended for the implementation of DGBL. Lastly, the role of teachers and their knowledge about educational design and pedagogies can help ensure the effectiveness of the DGBL. In conclusion, our systematic literature review found supportive evidence for DGBL to be an effective teaching tool if the three areas, game design and development, use of pedagogy, and role of teachers, were addressed.},

   abstract = {Socially assistive robots may help the treatment of autism spectrum disorder(ASD), through games using dyadic interactions to train social skills. Existing systems are mainly based on simplified protocols which qualitatively evaluate subject performance. We propose a robotic coaching platform for training social, motor and cognitive capabilities, with two main contributions: (i) using triadic interactions(adult, robot and child), with robotic mirroring, and (ii) providing quantitative performance indicators. The key system features were accurately designed, including type of protocols, feedback systems and evaluation metrics, contemplating the requirements for applications with ASD children. We implemented two protocols, Robot-Master and Adult-Master, where children performed different gestures guided by the robot or the adult respectively, eventually receiving feedback about movement execution. In both, the robot mirrors the subject during the movement. To assess system functionalities, with a homogeneous group of subjects, tests were carried out with 28 healthy subjects; one preliminary acquisition was done with an ASD child. Data analysis was customized to design protocol-specific parameters for movement characterization. Our tests show that robotic mirroring execution depends on the complexity and standardization of movements, as well as on the robot technical features. The feedback system evaluated movement phases and successfully estimated the completion of the exercises. Future work includes improving platform flexibility and adaptability, and clinical trials with ASD children to test the impact of the robotic coach on reducing symptoms. We trust that the proposed quantitative performance indicators extend the current state-of-the-art towards clinical usage of robotic-based coaching systems. © 2001-2011 IEEE.},

   abstract = {Background: The assessment of postural control in children is crucial, due to its central role in their overall development. However, a tool that objectively quantifies the difference in postural control between typical and atypical developing children is lacking. In this study, we introduce a new technology (Virtual Reality Rehabilitation System, VRRS) for assessing children's postural control. Research question: Is this new assessment tool capable to highlight the differences between typical development (TD) and atypical development, (children with Developmental Coordination Disorder (DCD) and Cerebral Palsy (CP))? Methods: 30 TD children, 20 children with DCD and 27 with CP (mean ages: 6.29 +/- 2.74; 9.11 +/- 2.65; 10.07 +/- 3.89 years) were tested with the VRRS Tablet with stabilometric balance platform. Postural parameters, related to the movements of the Centre of Pressure (COP) were collected. A multivariate analysis of variance (MANOVA) followed by a post-hoc analysis has been carried out. Moreover, the influence of age, sex, clinical scores and subdiagnoses on parameters of interest has been explored. Results: COP distance and sway area in the three groups (TD: 7.35 +/- 2.32 mm, 101.70 +/- 64.16 mm2/s; DCD: 12.05 +/- 8.19 mm, 188.46 +/- 231.23 mm2/s; CP: 13.25 +/- 8.09 mm, 239.13 +/- 313.83 mm2/s, respectively) and all other VRRS parameters were significantly different among the three groups (p-values between 0.028 and <0.001). The TD group showed significantly different values than CP (p from < 0.03 to < 0.001) but not than DCD (p = n.s.). Clinical scores showed to correlate with the COP distances and Root Mean Square distances in all subgroups (p < 0.05). For age, only an influence was found within the TD group (p < 0.01); sex did not show to affect the outcomes (p = n.s.). Significance: An objective tool for quantitative measurement of postural control in childhood is needed. Our proposed VRRS tool could support the traditional assessment tests, highlighting differences between typical and atypical development.},

   abstract = {This research is part of a WAS-5 robot project to make it possible to assist music therapist in treating Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) subjects. One of the challenges faced by ASD subjects is social skills where tempo matching is an important factor when interacting with other people such as conversations and physical activities. This research aims to develop a system that trains the subject to match the music tempo played by WAS-5 with a feedback system. The system evaluates the tempo of the subject's movement and varies the tempo of the music in real-time to guide the subject in order to achieve tempo synchronization. Tempo has been successfully captured in this research through the use of Optical Flow with USB camera and achieved better accuracy using PID control. However, error is still present due to hardware limitations and human factors. Future works includes the fine tuning of the PID to lower error rate, hardware upgrade for better image acquisition, and preliminary experiments with a group of ASD subjects before implementation into actual therapy.},

   abstract = {The diagnosis of Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) in children is commonly accompanied by a diagnosis of sensory processing disorders. Abnormalities are usually reported in multiple sensory processing domains, showing a higher prevalence of unusual responses, particularly to tactile, auditory, and visual stimuli. This article discusses a novel robot-based framework designed to target sensory difficulties faced by children with ASD in a controlled setting. The setup consists of a number of sensory stations, together with two different robotic agents that navigate the stations and interact with the stimuli. These stimuli are designed to resemble real-world scenarios that form a common part of one's everyday experiences. Given the strong interest of children with ASD in technology in general and robots in particular, we attempt to utilize our robotic platform to demonstrate socially acceptable responses to the stimuli in an interactive, pedagogical setting that encourages the child's social, motor, and vocal skills, while providing a diverse sensory experience. A preliminary user study was conducted to evaluate the efficacy of the proposed framework, with a total of 18 participants (5 with ASD and 13 typically developing) between the ages of 4 and 12 years. We derive a measure of social engagement, based on which we evaluate the effectiveness of the robots and sensory stations to identify key design features that can improve social engagement in children.},

Research published between January 2012 and May 2022 has been explored and specific inclusion and exclusion criteria have been applied to select articles. Fifty articles were selected and then reviewed with respect to (1) devices employed in research; (2) learning domains; (3) the number and academic level of participants, data collection methods, and duration of IVR activities; and (4) indicators and themes of visual attention. The main findings from this review demonstrate Tobii and HTC Vive are the most popular tools in research on eye-tracking technology usage in IVR learning environments. What's more, cognitive science and educational technology were found to be the most frequent domains in research on eye-tracking technology usage in IVR. The number of participants varied across reviewed articles but tertiary education was the most common academic level of participating students. Scholars used questionnaires and tests frequently to collect their research data. Fixation duration was the most frequently used indicator. The most frequent themes in reviewed research were task performance, teaching and learning strategies, and learning tools. The study concludes with suggestions for future research.},

Such a dichotomy omits a wide range of joint action tasks that require the coordination of two persons (e.g. moving a heavy furniture). The training of these physical tasks performed in dyad has great potential to foster inclusiveness while having an impact on both social and motor skills. In this paper, we present the design of a tangible and virtual interactive system for the training of children with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) in performing joint actions. The proposed system is composed of a virtual character projected onto a surface on which a tangible object is magnetized: both the user and the virtual character hold the object, thus simulating a joint action. We report and discuss preliminary results of a field training study, which shows the potential of the interactive system.},

With advancements in robotics, social robots can employ this role to assist in human-robot interaction scenarios for clinical and healthcare purposes. However, robotic intelligence still needs further development to match the wide spectrum of social behaviors and contexts in human interactions. In this paper, we present our robotic intelligence framework with a mutual learning paradigm in which we apply deep learning based on emotion recognition and behavior perception, through which the robot learns human movements and contexts through the interactive game of charades. Furthermore, we designed a gesture-based social game to provide a more empathetic and engaging social robot for the user. We also created a custom behavior database containing contextual behaviors for the proposed social games.

The creation of that stage work was at the same time an extensive experimental transdisciplinary research, a laboratory for movement analysis and movement composition. In particular, this paper will elaborate on the relation and collaboration between two of the fields involved, movement notation and media art. In 'afaao' fundamental principles from movement notation were paired with possibilities from modern media technology. The common ground they shared was the transformation process that movement undergoes when working with notation as well as when working with media art. The objective of this collaboration was to explore the complex phenomenon of movement and to create a work of art that would communicate the research revelations in a visually engaging way with the audience, offering alternative views on the movement's dynamic structures.},

   abstract = {Dance movement psychotherapy can be physically and psychologically beneficial for children with autism spectrum disorder. The coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic required therapy to take place online. However, tele-dance movement psychotherapy with children with autism spectrum disorder has yet to be studied. This mixed methods study involving qualitative research and movement analyses entailed providing tele-dance movement psychotherapy to children with autism spectrum disorder and their parents, during the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic, and exploring its potential benefits and challenges. The parents who completed the programme reported positive outcomes including the child's social development, enjoyment, improved understanding of their child, insight and ideas, as well as relationship-building. Movement analyses using the Parent Child Movement Scale (PCMS) lent greater insight into these developments. All of the parents reported challenges in participating in tele-dance movement psychotherapy. These were related to screen-to-screen interactions, home, and physical distance. There was a relatively high attrition rate. These findings highlight the challenges of tele-dance movement psychotherapy with children with autism spectrum disorder and the unique benefits of meeting in person whilst the positive outcomes may indicate that tele-dance movement psychotherapy can be beneficial, perhaps particularly as an interim or adjunct form of therapy. Specific measures can be taken to enhance engagement.},

In Germany, stress-induced work absenteeism costs about 20 billion Euros per year. Therefore, it is not surprising that the Central Federal Association of the public Health Insurance Funds in Germany ascribes particular importance to stress prevention and stress management as well as health enhancing measures. Building on current integrative and embodied stress theories, Creative Arts Therapies (CATs) or arts interventions are an innovative way to prevent stress and improve stress management. CATs encompass art, music, dance/movement, and drama therapy as their four major modalities. In order to obtain an overview of CATs and arts interventions’ efficacy in the context of stress reduction and management, we conducted a systematic review with a search in the following data bases: Academic Search Complete, ERIC, Medline, Psyndex, PsycINFO and SocINDEX. Studies were included employing the PICOS principle and rated according to their evidence level. We included 37 studies, 73% of which were randomized controlled trials. 81.1% of the included studies reported a significant reduction of stress in the participants due to interventions of one of the four arts modalities.},

Using a secondary reflexive research, it emphasizes the sensorimotor grounding of emotional empathy, and describes an intervention programme and a Mirroring Intervention Protocol (MIP) to strengthen the clinical and therapeutic applications of this “bottom-up” approach in improvement of empathy and relating. The MIP has been implemented in a feasibility study and in two randomized controlled trials (RCT) with overall positive effects on body awareness, social competence, boundary perception of self and others and well-being, but did not show statistical significance with regards to empathy. Findings further suggest an improvement of well-being and blunted affect (negative symptoms) after DMT. Moreover, the connection of mirroring and attachment has been recently established in an experimental study with neurotypical clients as an important ground for relating. Because of the importance of this discovery, we suggest that future research is needed to focus on the effects and possible benefits of mirroring techniques on attachment for participants with ASD.},

However, little is known about the impact of these virtual reality technologies on clinical health symptoms. The aim of this systematic review was to investigate the impact of augmented reality through social, cognitive, and behavioral domains in children and adolescents with autism. This study is the first contribution that has carried out an evidence-based systematic review including relevant science databases about the effectiveness of augmented reality-based intervention in ASD. The initial search identified a total of 387 records. After the exclusion of papers that are not research studies and are duplicated articles and after screening the abstract and full text, 20 articles were selected for analysis. The studies examined suggest promising findings about the effectiveness of augmented reality-based treatments for the promotion, support, and protection of health and wellbeing in children and adolescents with autism.
